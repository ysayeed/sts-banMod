# sts-BanMod
> Because sometimes less is more.

Have you loaded way, way, WAY too many mods in Slay the Spire? Are your decks absolutely bloated with thousands of cards, and it's impossible to build for any specific goal? Here's the solution!
Sometimes, you want control over your card choices — All sorts of choices, really. So, I've solved this by adding in EVEN MORE stuff! But this time, the relics will allow a new feature: banning cards.
Don't like Berserk? Ban it. Got all the Coolheadeds you want? Ban it. Want only Grand Finale as rewards? Ban everything else.

BanMod is a mod that's aimed at giving the player more choice. Because eventually, the mods make the decks so bloated, it's hard to find control. But, by selectively banning cards that don't fit your deck archetype, you'll be able to build towards the goals you want. This mainly introduces new relics, with a few cards and events as well, with the goal of adding a bit more control to your run after you'd downloaded every single mod available and blended it together in a cacophany of chaos.
